About Complain Desk
Ever tried complaining to your Institution or a Service Provider about a nagging issue you are facing? To solve most of these things, requires the one to lodge a complain as well as follow up on his complain to ensure it has been resolved.This is where the problem lies, apart from human error, the individual forgetting or the individual being flooded with the same issues which someone has complained about.

The large population or customer base of the service could easily overload the individual being complained to. The distance between the complainantâ€™s location and the office of the Institution or Service Provider, i.e. the great fixer and the daunting task to ensure it has been resolved hinders a smooth Customer experience and the Institutions ability to effectively tackle its problems.

Complain Desk aims to fix this nagging problem by offering a web application to tackle the problem of Customers or Users complains tracking and management in a simple but efficient way.

The goal is to easily place in the hands of customers or users a simple interface in order to make complaints to the right authorities easier and efficient. It also provides the opportunity to scan through earlier resolved issues or pending issues, this would prevent the institutions or organizations from being notified of the same issue several times. While allowing to track the status of complaints made and alerting the complainants when it is resolved.

On the institution or organizational side of things, this application prevents the institution from being overloaded with several individuals with different complaints in a day and having no way to put a track on all of them. This allows for the appropriate individual to be alerted, reminded, ask for progress report on behalf of the complainant and inform the complainant as soon as these has been resolved. This further allows for the institution to make improvement to their institution in areas where it is flawed.

It has also SMS and Email notification system which would allow and ensure updates to both users.

Complain Desk provides a clean user interface using the Laravel framework which allows for a simple and classic design which users can easily understand.

ComplainDesk in no way makes this assertion that there are not other means to make a complain. Either by virtue of a suggestion box, walking to the office of the appropriate individual or maybe just sending an email to the appropriate authority. But being part of institutions with some of the problems stated earlier we strongly view this as what is wrong with the complaint system. Especially for a large institutions or organizations, a simple enquiry or complain could be extremely frustrating and unnecessarily long.

This application is what we believe to be among the things missing in our various Institutions and Organizations in Ghana which would benefit both the Customers or Users and the institution.
